# Project On Pharmaceutical Sales Data Analysis, Visualization, and Profit Prediction 

I have worked as a data analyst for more than 4 years in Sinofi Pharma. Sinofi Pharma was a pharmaceutical marketing startup located in Bengaluru, India. Currently, the company is not active due to some reason. But I have managed to get its four years of sales data by maintaining its privacy agreement. This is the reason I can not share the actual data publicly. 

## AIM
Carry a complete descriptive, predictive, diagnostic, and prescriptive data analysis and make a machine learning model for net profit prediction. 

## TOOLS & LANGUAGE USED
- Python
- SQL
- Power BI

## FILES
You could find the coding files above to look at the approach that I took to carry out this analysis project. The codes could be verified with other data because I can not share the actual data due to the company privacy agreement.

## PROJECT
The project is published on â€˜mediumâ€™.
